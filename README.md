# SnakeGame
Based on the codes named sfSnake written by jhpy1024. And add some other functions
I change the snake body from rectangle to circle, 
and I portry the snake body using a white circle with green outline and a thin green rectangle over the circle.
I also give the snake a snake head which is totally green.
My game allows the mouse to control the snake,
it will move in a direction which is parallel to the position where the right key of your mouse is pressed to the position of snake head.
Press U to set a higher frame rate to let the snake move quicker while press I to get a lower speed.
You can also press Z, X or C to change the color of the background.
Press A to make the snake rotating clockwise, and D to make the snake rotating anticlockwise.
If you pressed B, the game will creat 5 triangle which I call "Badnodes" to. 
They will chase the snake head and once the snake head hit them, the game is over.
Use F to get a special view. 
And I named it "first person view" for the reason that the snake head would be put in the center of the screen 
and it would always face upward, the view you see would be things that you see in the direction of snake head.
Remember only AD-control will work when you are in "first person view" model.
